Release 0.9.2, updates and features

## A test runner

Run and debug tests in IntelliJ IDEA with the newly integrated runner!

The runner supports filtering (passed/failed), re-runs, jump to failed specs and stack trace navigation, plus running tests in parallel or grouped by tags.

## Code stubs

gauge run displays easy to copy stubs for unimplemented steps. This helps writing specifications incrementally for users who prefer to use command line interface or simpler text editors.

## Markdown previews in a browser

Preview Gauge specifications in a browser and use “Print” or “Save to PDF” functionality to share it with others.
