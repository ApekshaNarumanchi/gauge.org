The runner supports filtering (passed/failed), re-runs, jump to failed specs and stack trace navigation, plus running tests in parallel or grouped by tags.

## Code stubs

gauge run displays easy to copy stubs for unimplemented steps. This helps writing specifications incrementally for users who prefer to use command line interface or simpler text editors.
